# Hello, I'm Ajinkya K

I'm working as a data engineer for the past 2.5+ years, and I am responsible for building and maintaining end-to-end ELT/ETL data pipelines, converting data into informational insights by ingested data from a variety of sources and loaded it into raw location of our data lake thus helping the organisation to make data-driven decisions in the investment banking domain projects. I also worked on developing and maintaining data quality checks and metrics for the data pipelines and monitoring them.
